# AWS Authentication Credentials Setup

1. Go to the [AWS console](https://ubc-cicsso.awsapps.com/start#/)
2. Click on your AWS account, and choose: `Access Keys`
3. Select Mac/Linux as your OS, copy the text for _Option 1: Set AWS environment variables_. The three keys copied from here (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,AWS_SESSION_TOKEN) need to be pasted into the two environment files without the "export".

**Note**: This credential is temporary so there is a chance you have to repeat this while working.
