### Additional Context

-   We did not have much in terms of tasks as this week was mostly a planning week with a bunch of meetings to brainstorm
    and write the project plan.

### Goals

-   This week I started setting up the project for the team and completing tutorials for the parts of our tech stack I am
    unfamiliar with

    component library) to the project
-   I also started working on the NextJs tutorial

-   This week our team was just focused mainly on project setup and tutorials, so there is not an immense amount of
    feature completion yet and stuff like testing is not currently available
