### Goals

-   This week my group primarily worked on the project plan
-   We had several group meetings to determine our features for the project and for writing the
    project plan
-   We finished the plan, and wrote our weekly team and individual logs

### Tasks

-   For this week, I worked and completed the following tasks:
    -   [Team Log Week 4](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/4)
    -   [Complete and add project plan to repo](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/8)

-   The following task is in progress:
    -   [Update Project Board with Features](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/10)

### Additional Context

-   We did not have much in terms of tasks as this week was mostly a planning week with a bunch of meetings to brainstorm
    and write the project plan.

## Week 5 (02/10/2023 - 08/10/2023)

### Task Breakdown

### Goals

-   This week I started setting up the project for the team and completing tutorials for the parts of our tech stack I am
    unfamiliar with
-   This included initializing the NextJS project, setting up the database with docker, and adding Material UI (a
    component library) to the project
-   I also started working on the NextJs tutorial

### Tasks

Completed Tasks:

-   [Team Log Week 5](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/93)
-   [Individual Logs Week 5](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/94)
-   [Initialize Repo with NextJS Project](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/19)

-   [Add Jest to Project for Unit tests](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/28)

In Progress Tasks:

-   [Initial Project Setup](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/24)

### Additional Context

-   This week our team was just focused mainly on project setup and tutorials, so there is not an immense amount of
    feature completion yet and stuff like testing is not currently available

## Week 6 and 7 (09/10/2023 - 22/10/2023)

### Tasks Breakdown

### Goals

-   The main goal was progress towards completing the required features for the first milestone.
-   The project setup task is almost complete, and should be finished in the next few days
-   I also completed the Next.Js tutorial
-   Additionally, I was able to automatically deploy the project, which is a feature that was not required by this
    milestone. This included a lot of research, and setting up CD (so you get a preview build and a deployment build).
-   The last thing was that I started on designing a landing page for our website. The design mock is finished, but I have
    not started implementing it yet.
    -   The goal is to also have this done for the Mini Presentation Milestone (although it was not required)

### Tasks

#### Completed Tasks

-   [Complete NextJS Tutorial](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/91)
-   [Setup Project Deployment](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/106)
-   [Implement CI for Cypress Tests](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/103)

#### In Progress Tasks

-   [Initial Project Setup](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/24)
-   [Create Landing Page](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/111)

### Additional Context

-   Our group is still getting used to working with NextJS, and our velocity currently looks low but I think that is
    mainly due to that we are not working on many of the project features currently, but still doing a lot of research,
    meetings, and tutorials
