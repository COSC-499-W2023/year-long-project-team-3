### Week Goals

-   Started going through tutorials on Next.js and a refresh on Node.js
-   Review project code and make sure I have an understanding of the foundations of our project. Additionally, I did some light research on what my teammates were completing to understand exactly how they were completing their tasks.

### Additional Context

-   Project set up was being done this week so not much coding on my end could be done this week. I was also waiting on user creation to be completed before starting my task. I will be doing my given task of log in and log out next week.
