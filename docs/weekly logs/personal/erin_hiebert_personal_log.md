### Week Goals

-   Started going through tutorials on Next.js and a refresh on Node.js
-   Review project code and make sure I have an understanding of the foundations of our project. Additionally, I did some light research on what my teammates were completing to understand exactly how they were completing their tasks.

### Additional Context

-   Project set up was being done this week so not much coding on my end could be done this week. I was also waiting on user creation to be completed before starting my task. I will be doing my given task of log in and log out next week.

### Week Tasks

-   Research AWS Rekognition for face blurring  #289 (In Progress)

### Week Goals

-   My goal for this week was beginning on figuring out how to integrate face blurring in our app.  The discussion group on tuesday helped to direct some of the research but my lack of experience with AWS services proved to be difficult to easily understand the best way to complete the task.
-   Very possible that I will shift to a different task for next week.

-   This week I pivoted from AWS faceblurring to creation of a detail page for our submission boxes
-   Mocks were made for both receiving boxes and user's requested submission boxes.  That is a user is able to view all videos submitted to their submission boxes from other users AND requested submission boxes will show the video that the user has submitted to it.
-   At present, I finished coding and testing the receiving submission boxes detail page(s)

### Additional Context
