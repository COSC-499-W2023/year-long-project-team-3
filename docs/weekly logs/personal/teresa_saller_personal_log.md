### Tasks

Tasks on board:

-   [Add project plan to repo #8](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/8)

Tasks not on board:

-   Note-taking during the three team meetings we had this week
-   Writing up the project report for our team from those notes
-   Addressing feedback from my teammates
-   Adding empty files and templates for our personal and team logs

All tasks listed above were completed this week, so none are in progress.

### Goals

My goals this week were to brainstorm all tasks and finish the project plan.

### Additional Context

Since this week was a project planning week, we did not get started on features yet. We will start working on features next week.


## Teresa Saller - Week 5 (2023/10/02 - 2023/10/08)

### Tasks

Completed:

-   [Update Project Board with Features#10](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/10)
-   [Add PR template #37](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/37)

In progress:

-   [Setup Cypress #52](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/52)

This week, I updated the project board with all our features and added a PR template as part of our Initial Project Setup #24 feature.

### Goals

My goal this week was to help out Seth and Justin with project setup. I am hoping to finish setting up Cypress and maybe
start on our login/logout feature next week.

### Additional Context

This week was focused on setup, so not everyone was able to work on the project concurrently, as there were a lot of
dependencies.


## Teresa Saller - Week 6&7 (2023/10/09-2023/10/22)

### Tasks

Completed:
- [Setup Cypress#52](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/52)
- [Dockerize NextJs Application#30](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/30)
- [React Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

In progress:
- [Refactoring test directory #109](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/pull/109)
- [NextJS Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)

This week, I finished setting up our testing framework, Cypress. I also spent a lot of time going through tutorials for
the framework we are going to use, and dockerized our application to ensure operating system differences won't affect
development.

### Goals

My goal for this week was to finish setting up Cypress, which I accomplished. I was also planning on helping on login/
logout, but Erin has things under control, so I pivoted to doing more set-up work. My goal for next week is to have the
tutorial done and help my teammates wrap up any loose ends.

## Teresa Saller - Week 8 (2023/10/23 - 2023/10/29)

![teresa-saller-tasks-w8](imgs/teresa-saller-tasks-w8.png)

### Tasks

Completed:
- [NextJS Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)

In progress:
- [Login #126](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/pull/126)

This week, I finished the NextJS tutorial. I have also been working on login.

### Goals

My goal for this week was to have the tutorial done and help my teammates wrap up any loose ends. My goal for next week
is to have login properly wrapped up (write tests and do better form validation) and give a good presentation. 

### Additional Context

My PR depends on Erin and K's PRs, so it will be the last to get merged.
