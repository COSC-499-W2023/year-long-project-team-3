### Tasks

Tasks on board:

-   [Add project plan to repo #8](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/8)

Tasks not on board:

-   Note-taking during the three team meetings we had this week
-   Writing up the project report for our team from those notes
-   Addressing feedback from my teammates
-   Adding empty files and templates for our personal and team logs

All tasks listed above were completed this week, so none are in progress.

### Goals

My goals this week were to brainstorm all tasks and finish the project plan.

### Additional Context

Since this week was a project planning week, we did not get started on features yet. We will start working on features next week.
