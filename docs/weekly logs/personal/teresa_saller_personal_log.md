### Tasks

I took notes during the three team meetings we had this week in bullet point form.
Then I wrote up the project report for our team from those notes and addressed feedback from
my teammates. I also added empty files and templates for our individual and team reports.

### Goals

My goals this week were to brainstorm all tasks and finish the project plan.
