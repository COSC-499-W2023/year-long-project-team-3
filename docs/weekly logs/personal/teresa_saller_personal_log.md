### Tasks

Tasks on board:

-   [Add project plan to repo #8](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/8)

Tasks not on board:

-   Note-taking during the three team meetings we had this week
-   Writing up the project report for our team from those notes
-   Addressing feedback from my teammates
-   Adding empty files and templates for our personal and team logs

All tasks listed above were completed this week, so none are in progress.

### Goals

My goals this week were to brainstorm all tasks and finish the project plan.

### Additional Context

Since this week was a project planning week, we did not get started on features yet. We will start working on features next week.


## Teresa Saller - Week 5 (2023/10/02 - 2023/10/08)

### Tasks

Completed:
- [Update Project Board with Features#10](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/10)
- [Add PR template #37](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/37)

In progress:
- [Setup Cypress #52](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/52)

This week, I updated the project board with all our features and added a PR template as part of our Initial Project Setup #24 feature.

### Goals

My goal this week was to help out Seth and Justin with project setup. I am hoping to finish setting up Cypress and maybe
start on our login/logout feature next week.

### Additional Context

This week was focused on setup, so not everyone was able to work on the project concurrently, as there were a lot of
dependencies.
