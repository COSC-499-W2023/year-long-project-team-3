![teresa-saller-tasks-w4](imgs/teresa-saller-tasks-w4.png)

### Tasks

Tasks on board:

-   [Add project plan to repo #8](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/8)

Tasks not on board:

-   Note-taking during the three team meetings we had this week
-   Writing up the project report for our team from those notes
-   Addressing feedback from my teammates
-   Adding empty files and templates for our personal and team logs

All tasks listed above were completed this week, so none are in progress.

### Goals

My goals this week were to brainstorm all tasks and finish the project plan.

### Additional Context

Since this week was a project planning week, we did not get started on features yet. We will start working on features next week.


## Teresa Saller - Week 5 (2023/10/02 - 2023/10/08)

![teresa-saller-tasks-w5](imgs/teresa-saller-tasks-w5.png)

### Tasks

Completed:

-   [Update Project Board with Features#10](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/10)
-   [Add PR template #37](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/37)

In progress:

-   [Setup Cypress #52](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/52)

This week, I updated the project board with all our features and added a PR template as part of our Initial Project Setup #24 feature.

### Goals

My goal this week was to help out Seth and Justin with project setup. I am hoping to finish setting up Cypress and maybe
start on our login/logout feature next week.

### Additional Context

This week was focused on setup, so not everyone was able to work on the project concurrently, as there were a lot of
dependencies.


## Teresa Saller - Week 6&7 (2023/10/09-2023/10/22)

![teresa-saller-tasks-w6](imgs/teresa-saller-tasks-w6.png)

### Tasks

Completed:
- [Setup Cypress#52](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/52)
- [Dockerize NextJs Application#30](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/30)
- [React Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

In progress:
- [Refactoring test directory #109](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/pull/109)
- [NextJS Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)

This week, I finished setting up our testing framework, Cypress. I also spent a lot of time going through tutorials for
the framework we are going to use, and dockerized our application to ensure operating system differences won't affect
development.

### Goals

My goal for this week was to finish setting up Cypress, which I accomplished. I was also planning on helping on login/
logout, but Erin has things under control, so I pivoted to doing more set-up work. My goal for next week is to have the
tutorial done and help my teammates wrap up any loose ends.

This week, I finished the NextJS tutorial. I have also been working on login.

### Goals

My goal for this week was to have the tutorial done and help my teammates wrap up any loose ends. My goal for next week
is to have login properly wrapped up (write tests and do better form validation) and give a good presentation. 

### Additional Context

My PR depends on Erin and K's PRs, so it will be the last to get merged.

This week, I finished the Login PR. Our team spent quite a bit of time on presentation prep, and we were able to give a 
good presentation. I also worked on some minor UI fixes and got started making UI mocks for our dashboard.

### Goals

My goal for this week was to have login properly wrapped up (write tests and do better form validation) and give a good presentation.
My goal for next week is to continue working on my mocks while gathering feedback from my teammates.

This week, I continued making UI mocks for our dashboard. They are currently being reviewed by the team. I also worked on
making our Signin with Google compliant with Google's branding guidelines and worked on some minor UI/bug fixes.

### Goals

My goal for this week was to continue working on my mocks while gathering feedback from my teammates.
My goal for next week is to finalize the mocks for the video sending process.

My goal for this week was to finalize the mocks for the video sending process. My goal for next week is to finish
implementing the forms that I started, and work on the design document for our team.

a considerable amount of time making diagrams for our user interaction flow and writing up our UI changes for the Design
Document.

### Goals

My goal for this week was to finish implementing the forms that I started, and work on the design document for our team.

Researching ways to implement face-blurring using AWS, and another small UI improvement, see PR above.

### Goals

My goal for this week is to submit my UI improvement for review, and to put at least 6h into researching face-blurring.

### Additional Context


## Teresa Saller - Term 2: Week 2 (2024/01/15 - 2024/01/21)

![teresa-saller-tasks-w2-t2.png](imgs/teresa-saller-tasks-w1-t2.png)

### Tasks

Completed:
- [Research AWS Rekognition for face blurring #289](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/issues/289)
- [Add infrastructure for face blurring #302](https://github.com/orgs/COSC-499-W2023/projects/34/views/2?pane=issue&itemId=50057131)

In progress:
- [Add Avatar and Dropdown instead of Sign Out Button #295](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-3/pull/295)

We decided to focus more heavily on core features this week to be ready for peer-review. As part of this, I spent 20h+
this week researching AWS Rekognition and setting up infrastructure for faceblurring. As part of this:
- I set up the repo recommended by the client: https://github.com/aws-samples/rekognition-video-people-blurring-cdk
- I ran into and fixed the following errors:
  - `[ERROR]	2024-01-16T20:51:13.718Z	27912bcc-8966-4c3c-8899-468f1b5ae336	Lambda role does not have permission to call DetectFaces in Amazon Rekognition.`
    - needed to change region to us-west-2
  - `Error: fork/exec /lambda-entrypoint.sh: exec format error from cloud formation template`
    - needed to build the image for amd64 architecture, not arm64 which was the default for me since I am on an M2
- I brainstormed how to link the rekognition faceblurring pipeline to our existing streaming pipeline with @Hedgemon4 and we decided to use a lambda to transfer files between the rekognition output and streaming input bucket. This lambda also generates the metadata file containing the database id needed in the streaming pipeline. It does so using the video title. 

### Goals

My goal for this week is to help my team reach the goals we set for the peer-review deadline. If there is time, I would
like to implement logic to give the user a choice of whether they want their face blurred. Currently, we are always blurring
it.

### Additional Context

My code contributions for this week may look small, but that is because I spent so much time getting the pipeline to work.
None of what I did can really be tested easily, and this is the reason why I have not added any tests this week.

### Goals

My goal for this week was to help my team reach the goals we set for the peer-review deadline, and to potentially 
implement logic to give the user a choice of whether they want their face blurred. My goal for next week is to collect
good feedback in our peer-testing session, and to start fixing whatever issues the session uncovers. Also, I am currently
working on enabling larger files to be transferred between our rekognition and streaming pipelines.

### Additional Context

Since I worked a lot on infrastructure and bug testing, I only have one PR with tests.

### Goals

session uncovers. The feedback we received was generally positive, most of it just lead to smaller UI fixes. We discussed
features and brainstormed feedbacks in a team meeting and I added the [tasks we came up with](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KsMm4D5D9PheCWpZ02yLwP1AJmBTkQgDxlyA0grJiUU/edit?usp=sharing)
to GitHub. Also, I have been working on enabling larger files to be transferred between our rekognition and streaming 
pipelines.
