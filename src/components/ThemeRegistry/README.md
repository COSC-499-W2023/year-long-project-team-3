## Theme Info

- The files in this folder allow us to override the default MaterialUI theme with a custom theme
- Any options in the [theme](theme.ts) file will **override all components** in the **entire project**
- These files were sourced and adapted
  from [here](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/material-ui-nextjs-ts)
